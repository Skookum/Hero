We are very much interested in helping expand the .NET open source community. Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests.

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate.
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
4. Make the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

In terms of syntax please try and follow the conventions that can be seen in the current code base.

You can contribute in a number of ways including:

1. Feature enhancements
2. Writing more unit tests
3. Updating documentation
4. Submitting bug fixes
5. Submitting issues (we expect issue reports through Github issues)

Finally we use TeamCity for continuous integration. You can view the build results at [our TeamCity server](http://skookum.cloudapp.net/project.html?projectId=project7&tab=projectOverview).
