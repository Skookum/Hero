# Hero

Hero is an ability based authorization for .NET projects inspired by the Rails project [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) and by [Derek Bailey](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/05/24/dont-do-role-based-authorization-checks-do-activity-based-checks/).

# Installation

You can install this module via Nuget. The Nuget package is available from the [Skookum Nuget Server](http://skookum.cloudapp.net/guestAuth/app/nuget/v1/FeedService.svc/). Simply add this Nuget Server to your Visual Studio NuGet servers and you will have access to the latest version of Hero. Currently what exists in master is automatically pushed out as a NuGet package. Once Hero becomes more stable, this will change.

# Roadmap

Add future work here.

# Examples

See tests for examples right now. Will add offical examples later.
